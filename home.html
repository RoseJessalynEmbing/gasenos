                    <p>Gasan, officially the Municipality of Gasan (Tagalog: Bayan ng Gasan), 
                        is a 3rd class municipality in the province of Marinduque, Philippines.According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 36,197 people.

                        The municipality is bounded by the provincial capital, Boac, to the north and east, by Buenavista to the southeast and by the Sibuyan Sea to the south and west. It is the second-oldest municipality in Marinduque, after Boac. 
                        Residents of Gasan are called Gaseños.
                        The origin of the name of Gasan came from the term Gasang or Gasang-Gasang, a type of coral once abundant 
                        around the town's shoreline. Legend has it that when the Spaniards discovered the town, they found an old woman
                         near the banks of today's Matandang Gasan River. When asked in Spanish what was the name of the town, she interpreted it as 
                         if they were asking about what was the name of the corals growing around the area, with the Spaniards interpreting her answer as the name of the town. Over time, 
                        the term Gasang-Gasang was shortened to Gasang before being shortened further to Gasan.

                    <p>Marinduque just like any province in the Philippines boasts many beautiful churches. One of them is the Parish
                         of St. Joseph Spouse of Mary found in Gasan, Marinduque. It is situated on top of a hill so going there might be
                         a little tricky but the view is amazing because it overlooks the barangay and the sea. The first things that will 
                         perfectly catch your eye are the giant wooden doors. It has intricate carvings of St. Joseph, Mother Mary and the 
                         child Jesus. Once inside your eyes will wander up the ceiling which will ultimately remind you of a golden fan but 
                         if you scrutinize more it has the likeness of our national leaf and that is anahaw. They are spread across the ceiling just above the rows of pew. (Note: A pew are those long wooden bench where people sits in the Church). In addition there are also colorful 
                         stained glass window depicting scenes from the Bible.
